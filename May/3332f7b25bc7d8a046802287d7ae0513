1 May 2014 The 3rd May is celebrated worldwide as World Press Freedom day, as per the proclamation by the United Nations (UN) at its General Assembly in 1993, in line with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This followed the 26th session of UNESCO General Conference in 1991, which adopted the Windhoek Declaration, a statement of principles calling for a free, independent and pluralistic media throughout the world. The Declaration affirms that a free press is essential to the existence of democracy and a fundamental human goal. In the financial year 2013/14, as South Africa, we celebrated and marked 10 years of the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA). This year, we are celebrating 20 years of freedom and democracy. Coupled with this celebration is 20 years of media freedom and diversity in South Africa, 20 years of the licensing of Community Radio in SA, 20 years of independent broadcasting regulation and 20 years of the National Association of Broadcasters (NABSA).To mark this year s event, the MDDA will host a celebratory dialogue with the theme Celebrating 20 years of media freedom and media diversity at the GCIS, Tshedimosetso House, 1035 Frances Baard Street (corner Festival Street) HATFIELD, Tshwane, commencing at 09h00.
