30 January 2014The Deputy Minister in the Presidency for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Obed Bapela will on 31 January 2014, bid farewell to outgoing Board members of Media Diversity and Development Agency and also welcome and introduce a new board member. The two outgoing board members, Ms Nadia Bulbulia and Ms Nothando Migogo respectively, whose terms expired in December 2013, have immensely contributed to the smooth running of the board. The new Board member Mr Roland Aloysius Williams, a community activist who hails from Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape, where he currently serves as the Head of Communications of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, with his diverse expertise and experience will strengthen and enhance the work of the MDDA. This year the MDDA is also proudly celebrating its 10thanniversary. Its vision into its second decade is Access to Diversified Media for All .The mandate of the MDDA is to encourage the ownership, control and access to media by historically disadvantaged communities as well as by the historically diminished indigenous language and cultural groups.Since 2003, when the MDDA was established the Agency held its first grant awarding meeting in January 2004. With limited resources, in terms of the funding base, compared to the initial idea of setting up an Agency that should have enough financial and human resource muscle to change the media landscape, the Agency has nevertheless done more with less and made significant achievements in its infant stage. Members of the Media are invited to attend as follows: Venue: Emoyeni Conference Centre Date: 31 January 2014 Time: 13h00 For enquiries you can contact Ms. Harriet Maseko on 078 8008161 or Ms. Nomvula China Mngomezulu on 071 917 0876 Issued by GCIS 30 January 2014
