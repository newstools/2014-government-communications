Almost nine million young South African girls aged between 13 19 miss up to a week of school due to the fact that they cannot afford sanitary products. The slogan for this campaign is Empowering Girls in Schools which aims to restore dignity of young girls and add impetus to efforts around mass distribution of sanitary products to disadvantaged girls in schools across the nation. The launch will be a symbolic handover of sanitary products to two schools in Alexandra, namely: Minerva High School and Alexandra Secondary school. The deputy Minister will also be part of the panel discussion that will convene at the launch.
